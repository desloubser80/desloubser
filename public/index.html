                    After spending the first ten years of my career in business, I became more and more interested in the systems supporting businesses. This interest drove me to persue a career as a software developer. Initially my interest was based on databases and back end business logic. After some years in the software development industry, I am now striving to become an exceptional full stack developer focussing mainly on the MERN and MEAN stacks </p>
